# Verifying Gao Contracts

We have added a script to verify the contracts, hopefully we will be able to verify our contracts soon directly on TomoScan.

1.  Install dependencies
2.  Run script with the contract address to verify, `node verify-contract <contractAddress>`

Current contracts available to be verified:
```bash
node verify-contract 0x1f3a0B1AFafAfF3B0636Fae009CdCc252b93f52F
node verify-contract 0x5FE019E43913d847fFef24aD2EA0A6A00b5A3Ef0
```
